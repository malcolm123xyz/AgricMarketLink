<p style="text-align: justify;">Navrongo Senior High School was established in September 1960 by
    Ghana's first president Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. It was named President's College. The
    president indicated his dream that this school will become a great centre of learning in the
    north and that he will watch its progress with keen interest. Later, it was simply called
    Navrongo School (NAVASCO). Its mascot is the horn, an important northern Ghanaian symbol of
    royalty, bravery, and leadership. The school's motto is "LUX BOREALIS" in Latin. It means "The
    Light of the North". Old students are known as NABIA, a local word meaning Citizen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NAVASCO is one of few schools in northern Ghana with a wealth of
    physical infrastructure, a major reason for its ability to educate many people. It is the oldest
    and prestigious secondary school in the Upper East Region and among about eight elite schools in
    northern Ghana. In the 1970s, it became known for its agricultural activities under Mr.
    MacDonald, a veteran British educator. The school has a dam for irrigation farming and an
    orchard some few metres from the Chapel. There is the Kasadjan Sports Stadium for recreation.
    The famous MacDonald Hall serves assembly and entertainment purposes. The school library served
    the school and the community for years. A workshop also ensures that not much is bought from
    outside of school. Carpentry and metal works for all things on campus are carried out in this
    workshop. There were fourteen residential halls for students as at 2015. They are Kwegyir
    Aggrey, John F. Kennedy, Livingtone, Abatey, Ferguson, Garvey, Guggisberg, Nkrumah, Volta, and
    Abavana halls all for gentlemen. Slessor, Tono, Independence, and Luther King halls serves
    ladies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school offers programmes in Agricultural Science, General
    Science, General Business, General Arts, and Visual Arts and Home Economics. Students have
    numerous options to choose from in these general programmes. There is a well-equipped Science
    Laboratory and the School Farm both of which offer practical training to science students. The
    Debating Society is open to all students but is practically dominated by General Arts students
    who use it as a public speaking training ground.It has produced many of the famed politicians
    who graduated from this school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first headmaster was J.K Fiegbor. He was followed by Agyemang
    Dickson, Crawford, and then Mr. C.G MacDonald, probably the famous headmaster in the school's
    history. He used students to construct MacDonald Hall, the assembly place for students. Under
    him, the teaching of Mathematics so improved that it became a source of attraction for many
    talented students who wanted to better their Maths for progress into higher education. Mr.
    Adenze Kangah and Mr. Alosius Alexis Abem were also two well-known headmasters of the school in
    the 1980s before Madam Katumi assumed responsibility in the 1990s. She was instrumental in
    strengthening discipline and improving performance. Mr. Patrick Tangonyire took over in the
    2000s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school educated many of the north's elite. Others come from the
    southern parts of Ghana. Notable among its old students are Hawa Yakubu, Cletus Avoka, John
    Ndebugre, Martin Amidu, Haruna Iddrisu, Ambrose Dery, Dr Francis Ali-Osman,Air Marshal Michael
    Samson-Oje, Henry Ford Kamel and Prof. Albert Abane and Roland Agambire among many others. Many
    other old students came from other African countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a highly selective school which remains a top choice for
    students in the north and throughout the country. This is mainly attributable to the high
    academic standards, student culture and connections, pedigree, and discipline. Student numbers
    have increased over the years. It uses a unique numbering system called Folios. No two students
    have the same number. Old students immediately identify themselves with their numbers. This
    numbering system allows them to know who went to Navasco earlier. The school has a strong old
    students presence in the UK, North America and East Asia. NAVASCO is today headed by Madam
    xxxxxc, an old student.</p>
